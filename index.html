			<h4>NS&mdash;Why do you want to be a designer?</h4>
			<p>MF&mdash;I want to be a designer because I love to express my creativity. I have always been interested in using the computer to create rather than drawing or painting. I think graphic design is interesting because it can be anything such as a poster or a website. I want to be a designer because I can explore many avenues in my field. With my fine arts degree I hope to combine techniques I learned in school and use it to add my own twist onto graphic design.</p>

			<h4>NS&mdash;What worries you about being a designer?</h4>
			<p>MF&mdash;What worries me about being a designer would be finding a job after I finish school. I know there are many job opportunities out there for designers but I think the issue I will face after I graduate will be finding a job I truly enjoy doing everyday.</p>

			<h4>NS&mdash;What excites you about it?</h4>
			<p>MF&mdash;What excites me about design is that it is ever changing. In society today graphic design surrounds us in every way, whether it be in advertising or simple street signs. I think it is exciting to be apart of impacting society in a creative way. It is also exciting to find something that you truly enjoy doing and can see yourself doing for the rest of your life.</p>

			<h4>NS&mdash;What aspect of design do you gravitate towards most?</h4>
			<p>MF&mdash;An aspect of design I gravitate towards the most would be motion graphics. I have always been interested in the idea of moving images or animation. I like the idea of having your designs being able to interact with your audience through movement instead of static images.</p>

			<h4>NS&mdash;What role or responsibility does a designer play in our society?</h4>
			<p>MF&mdash;I think designers play a huge role in our society. Learning about graphic design I have learned that design is all around us, not just in posters. We learned about the New York subway system and that a designer had created all the signs to make navigating the system easier. After learning about this I realized that a designer can shape and change how we look at simple things in life.</p>

			<h4>NS&mdash;What is a website?</h4>
			<p>MF&mdash;I think a website is a page located on the world wide web held under a domain name, it can be for businesses, social media platforms, educational or games. A website is an interaction between the user and the computer.</p>
